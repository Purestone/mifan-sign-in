## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Purestone/mifan-sign-in.git
cd mifan-sign-in
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x mifan_sign.zsh
```

## Configuration

Edit the `mifan_sign.zsh` file and update the `accounts` array with your credentials:

```zsh
accounts=(
  "YOUR_USERNAME1" "YOUR_PASSWORD1"
  "YOUR_USERNAME2" "YOUR_PASSWORD2"
  "YOUR_USERNAME3" "YOUR_PASSWORD3"
)
```

- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME1`, `YOUR_USERNAME2`, etc. with your actual usernames

```bash
./mifan_sign.zsh
```

Or using zsh:
```bash
zsh mifan_sign.zsh
```

### Output Example

```
18:27:13 ACCOUNT1 签到结果: 签到成功
18:27:15 ACCOUNT2 签到结果: 今日已签到
18:27:17 ACCOUNT3 签到结果: 签到成功
```

### Automated Scheduling with Cron

To run the script automatically every day, add it to your crontab:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run daily at 8:00 AM
0 8 * * * /path/to/mifan-sign-in/mifan_sign.zsh >> /path/to/mifan-sign-in/sign.log 2>&1
```

## How It Works

1. **MD5 Encryption**: Passwords are hashed using MD5 before transmission
2. **Login**: The script logs in to mifan.61.com using HTTP POST request with form data
3. **Session Management**: Cookies are stored in temporary files for session management
4. **Sign-In**: Uses the authenticated session to perform daily sign-in
5. **JSON Parsing**: Python is used to parse JSON responses and extract results
6. **Cleanup**: Temporary cookie files are automatically removed after each sign-in
